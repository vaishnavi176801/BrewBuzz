##  What I Used to Build It

- **HTML & CSS** â€“ to structure and style the site.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ a faster way to style using utility classes.
- **JavaScript** â€“ to add interactive features.
- **Firebase** â€“ for hosting and user login/signup.
- **Unsplash API** â€“ to show coffee-related images.
- **OpenStreetMap** - to get all cafe names online

## Challenges I Faced

- **Getting Login and Signin to work** â€” Learned it can be done with firebase and used it
- **Making images fit properly** â€” used Tailwind to keep them from overflowing.
- **Finding Cfae images** There were not manyimage api for free so have to use uplash which did rarely had andy images related to cafes

## Short comings
**Learned REACT Late** I learned react while doing the project so couldnt really imbuild it in but had many places where I repeated many sections like footer and nav bar
**Image Issue** I feel If I could have an free api or anything I could have used that too make it more better for users
**Not what I Expected** I wanted to have a better user eperience where they can add distance or store cafes they like so they can visit later but I realized as i made I waned to add more and more features so ended it here.
